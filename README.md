# Simple Character Counter

This is a very simple in-browser character counter. It does nothing fancy. Just counts as you type and displays the result.

The only consession to lushness is the background â€“ it loads a random image from Flickr.

First release keeps everything in one file, too, for ultimate portability (I originally made it so it could sit conveniently on my desktop).
